<!-- your comment  Code is organized in three sections. The data processing part of the code can be used to reproduce emotion score data files from the list of YouTube urls for the videos included in the sample. It can be easily modified to expand the sample to a larger number of videos. Face and emotion detection relies heavily on fer Python library and that part of the code is presented in the Jupyter notebook. Finally, we have data analysis scripts for performing data wrangling and statistical tests as well as producing figures 2,3 and 4. -->
